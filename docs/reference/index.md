# Reference Documentation

Technical specifications, architecture guides, and implementation references.

## Rust Port Assessment

Comprehensive analysis of porting OpenClaw to Rust or creating a functional replica with full feature parity.

- **[Rust Feasibility Assessment](/reference/rust-feasibility-assessment)** - Complete 10-section analysis covering architecture, dependencies, challenges, benefits, and cost estimation
- **[Executive Summary](/reference/rust-port-executive-summary)** - Condensed overview for technical leadership and stakeholders
- **[Technical Comparison](/reference/rust-typescript-comparison)** - Side-by-side code examples comparing TypeScript and Rust implementations
- **[Implementation Roadmap](/reference/rust-implementation-roadmap)** - Detailed step-by-step guide for the recommended hybrid approach

**Key Finding:** A full port is NOT recommended (3-4 years, $3-5M), but a **hybrid approach** (7-9 months, manageable risk) offers the best path to performance gains while maintaining ecosystem compatibility.
